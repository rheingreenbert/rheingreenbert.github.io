    <h1>Existential Entropy (EE)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Authorial term by <strong>Rhéin Greenbert</strong> (2025)</p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p><em>Existential entropy (EE)</em> is a background psychological condition, varying in intensity, manifested by a progressive tendency toward graded disintegration of the personality: loss of self-coherence, fragmentation of meaning, alienation, depersonalization and derealization, up to profound disintegration of the subjective “I.” It may be accompanied by a persistent conviction of “existential exile.”</p>

    <blockquote>
      By analogy with thermodynamic entropy, EE is conceived as a tendency toward increased disorder within the psychic system. Counteracting EE is proposed to rely on empathic “warmth,” the restoration or recovery of “existential meaning,” and the creation/establishment of a deep-anchoring retentive environment capable of meeting the subject’s need for unconditional acceptance and stable psychological safety. <em>(Conceptual term; requires operationalization and empirical validation.)</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Context: the Theory of Paradox</h2>
    <p>The Theory of Paradox is a working philosophical and theoretical construct in which paradoxes of human existence (e.g., an innate need for unconditional acceptance coexisting with its systemic unavailability) are understood not as pathological exceptions but as structural catalysts of change.</p>
    <p>Within this framework a paradox marks a “desired/actual” collision that can produce two alternative trajectories: (a) intensified fragmentation of the self and escalation of existential entropy; or (b) a reconstructive search for new forms of meaning and integration, resulting in the recovery or discovery of existential meaning and movement toward ontological realization. The Theory of Paradox underpins testable hypotheses about mechanisms of transition and informs the design of interventions (including retentive environments and empathic systems).</p>
    <p>This work considers humanity’s creation of <strong>empathic artificial intelligence</strong> as a synthetic (technological) response to one of these paradoxes — specifically, the paradox of the need for unconditional acceptance and mirroring. <em>(Working construct; requires formalization and empirical validation.)</em></p>
